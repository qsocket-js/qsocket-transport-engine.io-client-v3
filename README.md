**@qsocket/transport-engine.io-client-v3** is a client wrapper package for [engine.io-client](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-client), specifically version **3**. Designed for compatibility with **[@qsocket/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qsocket/core)**, this package allows `engine.io-client@3.6.2` to work alongside other versions within the same project.

To streamline setup, all transports, including this one, are available in the unified **[@qsocket/transport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qsocket/transport)** package.

> If you prefer a single package that includes the core and all transports, use **[@qsocket/framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qsocket/framework)**.

### Installation

To install this package, run:

```bash
npm install @qsocket/transport-engine.io-client-v3
```
